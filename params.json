Some of them are:\r\n\r\n### [Grunt YUI Compressor](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/grunt-yui-compressor)\r\nThe Grunt YUI Compressor minify all js and css files in your folders in the **assets** directory.\r\n\r\n### [Grunt contrib Concat](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat)\r\nThe Grunt contrib concat (as the name says), concatenates all js and css files in your folders in the **assets** directory.\r\n\r\n### [Grunt watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)\r\nThis feature serves to perform all other tasks to verify any change in any file in the folders listed in `gruntfile.js` file. Just run the `grunt watch` command and start working!\r\n\r\n**Obs:** To execute css or js tasks separately (concat and minify), just run `grunt css` for css files or `grunt js` for js files.\r\n\r\n## Follow-me\r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samwebdesign)\r\n* [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/+SamuelMartins/posts)","google":"UA-46293956-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
